        <h2>Overview</h2>

        <p class="muted">
          As an Aerospace Researcher at Illinois Tech, I am currently conducting research in
          Global Navigation Satellite System Reflectometry (GNSS-R), focusing on the processing
          and analysis of reflected GNSS signals collected over Antarctic glacial surfaces.
          Working with raw radio-frequency data acquired using a USRP-based receiver, I am
          developing MATLAB-based signal processing algorithms to extract surface reflection
          characteristics and quantify signal-to-noise behavior in low-SNR environments.
        </p>

        <p class="muted">
          My work involves analyzing the raw data and applying coherent and incoherent
          integration techniques to isolate weak surface reflections from noise and system
          effects. By varying integration strategies and accumulation lengths, I am evaluating
          how reflected signal strength evolves with processing time, enabling robust estimation
          of reflection detectability and stability. This research bridges raw signal
          processing with physical interpretation of cryospheric surface properties and is
          contributing to an upcoming publication. Through this work, I am gaining experience
          in experimental GNSS-R analysis, algorithm development, and research-level technical
          communication.

          <h3>Raw Data Confirmation (probedata.m)</h3>
          <p class="muted">
            I am currently validating each acquisition day by inspecting the raw USRP binary
            recordings before performing any higher-level GNSS-R processing. Using a MATLAB
            workflow (probedata.m), I generate a compact set of diagnostics — a time-domain
            trace, a Welch power spectral density estimate, and a histogram of sample values —
            to confirm signal integrity, identify noise-only captures, and flag configuration
            or hardware-related irregularities.
          </p>
          <p class="muted">
            This step allows me to directly compare field recordings against lab-collected
            noise references and use both spectral signatures and on-site notes to justify data
            screening decisions (including the exclusion of identified noise-only segments)
            before downstream analysis.

          <h3>SNR Processing (Coherent &amp; Incoherent Integration)</h3>
          <p class="muted">
            After raw-data confirmation, I am currently quantifying reflected-signal strength
            through signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) processing using coherent and incoherent
            integration techniques. By systematically varying coherent accumulation lengths and
            applying incoherent averaging, I evaluate how detectability improves with
            integration time while accounting for signal decorrelation and measurement
            variability across collection periods.
          </p>
          <p class="muted">
            This SNR workflow provides a consistent, repeatable basis for comparing reflection
            quality across sites and days, and it supports the interpretation of reflected GNSS
            signal behavior over glacial surfaces for inclusion in the upcoming publication.
