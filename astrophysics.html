           OVERVIEW
      ======================== -->
      <section class="card">
        <h2>Overview</h2>

        <p class="muted">
          As an Astrophysics Researcher at Illinois Tech, I have been leading a project to
          examine the formation mechanisms and classification of Sub-Subgiant stars. I
          have analyzed stellar spectra of 98 systems to extract radial velocities and
          orbital parameters of each stellar source. To complement this observational data,
          I built Monte Carlo simulations of synthetic binary populations, with which I was
          able to directly compare the modeled distributions to the observed data.
        </p>

        <p class="muted">
          I am currently writing this work into a publishable document, focusing on the
          interpretation of the observational data and statistical results. My analysis
          indicates that Sub-Subgiant stars are predominantly found in binary systems, reinforcing
          binarity as a fundamental characteristic of this stellar population. My efforts
          toward this publication include synthesizing these results within existing
          theoretical formation channels and developing a consistent interpretation of the
          observed orbital properties. This paper aims to present a statistically grounded
          classification of Sub-Subgiant systems and their dominant formation mechanisms.

           RESEARCH WORKFLOW
      ======================== -->
      <section class="card" style="margin-top:14px;">
        <h2>Research Workflow</h2>

        <p class="muted">
          This project is organized as a single end-to-end workflow: converting spectroscopy into radial velocities,
          interpreting those velocities through synthetic population modeling, and testing formation hypotheses using
          distribution-level statistics. The sections below summarize the major pieces of that workflow, with representative
          figures from the manuscript draft included where they best illustrate the approach.
        </p>

        <!-- 1) RV Extraction / BF -->
        <div class="card" style="margin-top:12px;">
          <h3>Radial Velocity Extraction (Broadening Functions)</h3>

          <p class="muted">
            The foundation of the analysis is a radial-velocity extraction pipeline built around broadening functions (BFs).
            For each system, the spectra are processed to compute BFs and classify their morphology (e.g., SB1, SB2, or asymmetric
            profiles). These BF profiles are then fit to extract radial-velocity measurements across epochs, with uncertainty estimates
            derived through resampling methods (bootstrap) to provide realistic error bars for each measurement.
          </p>

          <p class="muted">
            This approach produces a consistent set of RV curves across the sample and enables direct, quantitative measures of variability.
            In addition to the epoch-by-epoch velocities, semi-amplitude-style metrics (e.g., K estimates from extrema in the measured RVs)
            are computed as a compact representation of each system’s RV variability. Those derived distributions become the key connection
            point between the observed sample and the synthetic populations tested later in the workflow.

        <!-- 2) Monte Carlo population modeling -->
        <div class="card" style="margin-top:12px;">
          <h3>Population Modeling (Monte Carlo Synthetic Binaries)</h3>

          <p class="muted">
            To interpret the observational RV variability, I constructed Monte Carlo simulations of synthetic binary populations.
            Rather than comparing “true” orbital parameters directly, the simulations are designed to reproduce what the observations
            would have measured under realistic cadence limitations. Each synthetic population begins with a candidate underlying period
            distribution (e.g., field-like vs short-period or tidally synchronized scenarios) and then draws the additional orbital and
            geometric parameters needed to generate RV curves.
          </p>

          <p class="muted">
            A critical step is forward-modeling the observing cadence: synthetic orbits are sampled in clustered “bursts” that mimic the
            multi-night observational structure common in real campaigns. This makes the comparison fair; because sparse sampling can systematically
            underestimate a system’s true semi-amplitude, the simulations explicitly capture those effects. The result is a set of synthetic,
            observation-matched semi-amplitude distributions that can be compared directly to the measured distribution from the SSG sample.
          </p>

        <!-- 3) Results: CDF + KS -->
        <div class="card" style="margin-top:12px;">
          <h3>Results (CDF Comparison &amp; K–S Statistical Testing)</h3>

          <p class="muted">
            The core results are presented as distribution-level comparisons between observed and simulated semi-amplitude behavior.
            For each candidate population model, the synthetic semi-amplitudes are converted into cumulative distribution functions (CDFs),
            which are then compared against the measured CDF from the observational sample. This format makes it easy to see which models
            reproduce the overall structure of the data and which deviate systematically (for example, by producing too many low-variability
            systems or failing to generate the observed high-amplitude tail).
          </p>

          <p class="muted">
            To move beyond qualitative agreement, I apply two-sample Kolmogorov–Smirnov (K–S) testing to quantify consistency between each
            modeled distribution and the observed sample. Together, the CDF overlays and K–S results provide a statistical basis for evaluating
            proposed formation scenarios. In the current manuscript, this analysis supports the interpretation that Sub-Subgiants are predominantly
            binaries and that short-period / synchronized scenarios best reproduce the observed variability, while broader field-like period
            distributions are less consistent with the data.

          <h3>Orbital Fitting (The Joker) <span class="note">— next phase</span></h3>

          <p class="muted">
            A parallel track of the project is orbital inference using <i>The Joker</i>, which provides a Bayesian framework for fitting orbital
            solutions to RV time series. This component is being developed as a continuation of the RV extraction work, but it is not yet included
            in the current manuscript draft. The motivation is to move from semi-amplitude distributions to full posterior constraints on parameters
            such as period, eccentricity, and semi-amplitude for systems with sufficient temporal coverage.
          </p>

          <p class="muted">
            In practice, this involves defining priors appropriate for Sub-Subgiant binaries, sampling orbital posteriors from each RV dataset,
            and validating solutions through diagnostics and posterior predictive checks. As this work matures, it will enable per-system orbital
            solutions alongside the population-level conclusions already supported by the CDF and K–S analysis, and it will provide a direct bridge
            from “confirmed binarity” to well-characterized orbital architectures.

        <div class="card" style="margin-top:12px;">
          <h3>Publication (Writing &amp; Interpretation)</h3>

          <p class="muted">
            The current phase of the project is focused on consolidating the pipeline, simulations, and statistical conclusions into a publishable manuscript.
            This includes writing the methods in a reproducible way (so that the BF extraction and uncertainty model are clearly defined), presenting the population
            modeling with explicit cadence effects, and organizing the results around hypothesis-driven distribution tests rather than isolated case studies.
          </p>

          <p class="muted">
            The discussion work is where the observational constraints are connected back to formation theory. Here, the goal is to present a coherent interpretation
            of what the RV variability and distribution-level statistics imply about the Sub-Subgiant population—specifically, that binarity is a defining characteristic
            and that the data are most consistent with short-period / synchronized scenarios. This manuscript is being prepared as a first-author publication and is
            intended to serve as both a classification result and a statistically grounded constraint on dominant formation pathways.
