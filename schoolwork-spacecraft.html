        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          This page highlights my work in both <b>Spacecraft Dynamics</b> and <b>Spacecraft Design</b>.
          In Spacecraft Dynamics, my team designed a full mission trajectory to the Jovian system. I used real orbital
          elements/ephemerides to build a multi-moon intercept trajectory in Python and wrote the final technical report
          documenting the transfer, retrograde insertion, and moon-to-moon targeting adjustments.
        </p>

        <p style="margin-top:10px;">
          In Spacecraft Design, my team brought a Titan lake mission concept to the <b>Preliminary Design Review (PDR)</b> stage,
          including a complete trajectory/timeline, subsystem trade studies, and a final report.

            The goal of this project was to design a mission trajectory that visits <b>ten</b> of Jupiter’s moons in a single mission:
            three outer moons (chosen to be retrograde irregulars due to their scientific interest), the four Galilean moons,
            and three inner moons. Throughout the semester, we developed and applied spacecraft dynamics concepts—ranging from
            interplanetary transfers to moon-targeting maneuvers—to construct a physically consistent and executable mission.
            My work focused on shaping and optimizing the overall trajectory to accommodate both prograde and retrograde targets
            while remaining within mission constraints, particularly total &Delta;v limits and minimizing time spent within
            Jupiter’s intense radiation belts (defined here as within 1,000,000 km of the planet).
          </p>

              <h4 style="margin:0 0 6px 0;">Trajectory Visualization</h4>

              <p>
                This is the full simulated trajectory animation produced from my Python simulation. At the time, the plotting package I used
                did not make it easy to style the spacecraft separately, so the spacecraft marker blends in with the moon markers. The mission
                sequence is best followed by watching the trajectory changes between flybys and transfers.
              </p>

              <p>
                The animation begins with insertion from the Earth–Jupiter transfer into a wide, retrograde
                orbit, allowing the spacecraft to reduce relative velocity before its first targeting correction.
                The probe then executes a dual flyby of the retrograde irregular moons <b>Pasiphae</b> and
                <b>Carme</b>, followed by a retargeting maneuver to intercept <b>Ananke</b>.
              </p>

              <p>
                After the outer-moon sequence, the trajectory transitions to an alignment point that enables
                Hohmann-like transfers within the inner Jovian system. Using Lambert-based targeting solutions,
                the spacecraft performs sequential flybys of the Galilean moons—<b>Callisto</b>, <b>Ganymede</b>,
                <b>Europa</b>, and <b>Io</b>—working from the outer system inward.
              </p>

              <p>
                Following the Galilean encounters, the probe continues inward to fly by the inner moons
                <b>Thebe</b>, <b>Amalthea</b>, and <b>Adrastea</b>. After completing the final encounter,
                the spacecraft expends its remaining thrust and is designed to decay into Jupiter’s atmosphere,
                formally concluding the CAPRICORN mission.

              <p>
                The CAPRICORN mission was built as a step-by-step trajectory, starting with an Earth–Jupiter transfer and a retrograde
                insertion into the Jovian system. From this wide initial orbit, the spacecraft first targets the outer retrograde
                irregular moons, then gradually works inward to the Galilean and inner moons using retargeted, Hohmann-like transfers
                and Lambert-based solutions. Structuring the mission this way made it possible to reach high-value retrograde targets
                while staying within realistic &Delta;v limits and reducing time spent in Jupiter’s most intense radiation regions.

            <div class="card">
              <h4 style="margin:0 0 6px 0;">What this taught me</h4>
              <p>
                This project moved beyond solving standalone orbital mechanics problems and into the challenges of full mission design.
                I learned how to translate two-body dynamics into a practical trajectory plan by selecting appropriate transfer methods,
                designing encounter geometries that enable sequential targeting, tracking &Delta;v and timing tradeoffs, and validating
                the full mission through numerical simulation and visualization—where each maneuver has to work in service of the entire sequence.

            The goal of this project was to develop a complete mission concept and carry it through the
            <b>Preliminary Design Review (PDR)</b> stage. Over the semester we expanded beyond the orbital dynamics work from the
            previous course and into systems-level mission design—communications (spacecraft-to-spacecraft and to Earth),
            propulsion, spacecraft configuration, thermal/material considerations, and how these subsystems drive one another.
            This final project was the culmination of that progression, where our team demonstrated an end-to-end mission design
            that could be defended at PDR.
          </p>
          <p style="margin-top:10px;">
            My work focused on the mission trajectory and timeline, propulsion sizing (including &Delta;v and propellant mass),
            and initial <b>ADCS</b> feasibility for entry and on-orbit pointing, while also contributing across subsystems and keeping the overall mission
            concept consistent. Our final design delivers a semi-submersible surface vehicle to Titan’s <b>Kraken Mare</b> using a
            carrier/orbiter system, and returns data through deployed relay satellites to maintain continuous (or near-continuous)
            communications during lake operations.

              <h4 style="margin:0 0 6px 0;">Mission concept (high level)</h4>
              <p>
                The mission begins with the launch and insertion into an Earth-Saturn interplanetary transfer selected using porkchop
                plot analysis. Upon arrival, the transfer craft targets Titan and enters the atmosphere on an intercept trajectory which
                enables <b>aerobraking</b>, reducing transfer velocity while capturing into the moon's orbit. After orbit circularization,
                two relay satellites are deployed into phased orbits to establish constant communication coverage. With the relay satellites
                in place, hte carrier guides the surface vehicle through descent and splashdown at Kraken Mare, after which surface science
                operations can occur with data transmitted through the orbiters back to Earth.
