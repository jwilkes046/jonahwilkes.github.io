        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p class="muted">
          I am an Aerospace Engineering student at Illinois Tech with a strong academic focus on dynamics, simulation, and systems-level analysis. Through a series of
          semester-long, project-based courses, I have developed experience applying theoretical concepts in aerodynamics, astrodynamics, and navigation to
          open-ended engineering problems. The work highlighted below represents three major projects from Aircraft Design, Spacecraft Dynamics and Design, and
          Introduction to Navigation Systems, each emphasizing the translation of fundamental principles into practical modeling, analysis, and design decisions.
          Together, these projects reflect my interest in understanding how complex aerospace systems are modeled, simulated, and evaluated across multiple domains.

          <h3>Aircraft Design</h3>
          <p class="muted">
            In my Aircraft Design coursework at Illinois Tech, I led the conceptual and preliminary design of a fixed-wing aircraft, taking primary 
            responsibility for the aerodynamic configuration, performance analysis, and control development. Working within a small team, I guided 
            early design decisions including overall sizing, wing planform definition, and airfoil selection, translating high-level mission requirements 
            into a viable aircraft configuration. Later in the semester, I conducted detailed aerodynamic analysis using XFLR5, developed custom MATLAB scripts 
            to extract and process aerodynamic data, and integrated these results into a Simulink-based flight control model. I evaluated aircraft performance 
            and stability across multiple flight conditions and maneuvers, gaining experience connecting aerodynamic design, dynamic modeling, and 
            control system behavior in a cohesive aircraft analysis.

          <h3>Spacecraft Dynamics and Design</h3>
          <p class="muted">
            My coursework in Spacecraft Dynamics and Spacecraft Design provided a two-semester progression from orbital mechanics fundamentals to full mission
            systems engineering. In Spacecraft Dynamics, I designed and simulated interplanetary trajectories for a multi-flyby mission involving ten of Jupiter’s 
            moons, developing numerical trajectory models from first principles using Python and the <code>REBOUND</code> N-body simulation framework. This work involved 
            constructing three-dimensional, time-resolved spacecraft trajectories and evaluating orbital behavior across multiple mission phases. In the subsequent 
            Spacecraft Design course, I applied these astrodynamics methods within a broader systems-engineering context while contributing to the design of an
            unmanned mission to Saturn’s moon Titan. I led trajectory design efforts while also collaborating on spacecraft architecture, payload deployment concepts,
            and surface exploration systems, including deployable satellites and a submersible vehicle intended for Titan’s methane lakes. Together, these projects
            emphasized the integration of orbital mechanics, numerical simulation, and systems-level mission design.

          <h3>Navigation Systems</h3>

          <p class="muted">
            My coursework in Introduction to Navigation Systems, supported by my Optimal State Estimation course, established a strong foundation in modern 
            positioning and estimation theory. Through lecture material and a cumulative project, I developed a working understanding of satellite-based navigation 
            systems, including GNSS positioning, differential GPS techniques, and augmentation methods. I applied state-space modeling and Kalman filtering 
            to estimate position and velocity in the presence of measurement noise and uncertainty, gaining familiarity with how navigation solutions are 
            constructed and evaluated. The course emphasized estimation structure, error sources, and solution robustness, providing conceptual grounding 
            that has informed my understanding of navigation and signal processing research.
