            The goal of this project was to develop a multi-functional agricultural aircraft, with autonomous functionality when
            dusting crops, as well as with space for manual piloting during ferry missions. Throughout the semester, the project
            progress from a requirements-driven Conceptual Design Report (mid-semester) to final aircraft model and performance
            evaluation in a Final Design Report. My work focused on sizing an aerodynamic decisions early, then on building an
            aerodynamic dataset using XFLR5 and integrating it into a flight dynamics/control simulation for maneuver performance
            using Simulink.

            <h3>Design Approach</h3>
            <p>
              I documented a requirements-driven approach that connects mission needs (payload, flight profile, and operational constraints)
              to a feasible baseline configuration. The goal was to make early decisions traceable: every geometry or sizing choice had a
              performance or constraint-based reason behind it.

            <p>
              I performed the first-pass sizing using wing loading as the primary driver, then iterated fuel fraction, empty weight fraction,
              and gross weight estimation to converge on a consistent design point. This included trade study logic to understand how sizing
              choices moved the aircraft through the feasible design space.

              The chosen airfoil and wing sizing were then carried forward as the aerodynamic baseline for the final configuration and later
              simulation work.

              or other configuration effects). These processed outputs were packaged into a form suitable for lookup/interpolation inside the

            <h3>GPS Positioning Testing</h3>
            <p>
              At the same time I was completing this course, I was also taking Introduction to Navigation Systems, which got me thinking
              about how GPS positioning would work for an aircraft like this. So, I developed an MATLAB code to express a short GPS 
              positioning representation of the aircraft's final approach flight path, using satellite position estimation concepts from 
              my concurrent Navigation coursework. The image on the right is the result of my modeling, which included the simulation
              of 32 satellites at different orbits, their measurements of the aircraft's position (in ECEF coordinates) at each second, 
              random error due to sources such as receiver noise, satellite and receiver clock offsets, and ionosperic and tropospheric 
              delays consistent with GPS error sources, and the simulated correction of this error using typical GPS filtering techniques.
            </p>
            <p>
              While I do admit that this is a completely arbitrary and user-controlled method of estimating position, I included this in my 
              report as a test of what I learned and understood about Navigation, as well as an exploration of the applications of GPS 
              positioning in the Aerospace field.
