        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p class="muted">
          NASA L'SPACE is a nationally competitive NASA workforce development program focused on
          mission concept development and technical proposal evaluation. Through team-based
          projects, participants gain hands-on experience in systems engineering, mission design,
          and professional technical communication aligned with real NASA review processes.

        <h2>Mission Concept Academy (MCA)</h2>

        <p>
          As the primary Mechanical Engineer on a NASA L’SPACE Mission Concept Academy team, I led
          the mechanical design of a Mars Rover mission concept developed under NASA systems
          engineering standards. I produced a detailed rover CAD model in <b>Siemens NX</b>,
          integrating mechanical structure with thermal, payload, power, and communications
          subsystems, and worked closely with cross-disciplinary teams to ensure interface
          compatibility and feasibility.
        </p>

        <p>
          In addition to design work, I led the development of the mission <b>Concept of Operations
          (ConOps)</b>, defining four distinct operational phases and coordinating subsystem
          requirements across the mission lifecycle. I supported the project through
          <b>Preliminary Design Review (PDR)</b> and presented technical results to a
          <b>NASA Standing Review Board</b>, gaining direct experience with NASA-style design reviews,
          documentation standards, and interdisciplinary collaboration.

        <h2>NASA Proposal Writing Evaluation Experience (NPWEE)</h2>

        <p>
          As a Mission Designer in the NASA Proposal Writing and Evaluation Experience (NPWEE), I
          contributed to the development of a full NASA-style mission proposal within a
          multidisciplinary team. My work included mission formulation support and authorship of
          technical proposal sections, with an emphasis on clarity, feasibility, and alignment with
          NASA solicitation requirements.
        </p>

        <p>
          At the end of this program, I served as a reviewer for peer team proposals, evaluating 
          submissions using formal NASA review rubrics in a <b>Standing Review Board</b> format. 
          This role provided hands-on exposure to NASA’s proposal evaluation process, strengthening 
          my understanding of how technical merit, risk, and communication quality influence proposal
          competitiveness.
